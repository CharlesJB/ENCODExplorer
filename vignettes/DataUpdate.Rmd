ENCODEdb: A compilation of metadata from ENCODE
====================================================================

This package and the underlying ENCODEdb code are distributed under 
the Artistic license 2.0. You are free to use and redistribute this software. 

"The ENCODE (Encyclopedia of DNA Elements) Consortium is an international 
collaboration of research groups funded by the National Human Genome Research 
Institute (NHGRI). The goal of ENCODE is to build a comprehensive parts list of 
functional elements in the human genome, including elements that act at the 
protein and RNA levels, and regulatory elements that control cells and 
circumstances in which a gene is active"[^1].

However, data retrieval and downloading can be really time-consuming using 
the current web portal. 

This package has been designed to facilitate data access by compiling the 
metadata associated with file, experiment and dataset. 

We first extract ENCODE schema from its public github repository. 
Then we identify the main entities and their relationship with each other to 
rebuild the ENCODE database into an SQLite database. 
We also developped a function which can extract the essential metadata in a R 
object to aid data exploration.
We implemented time-saving features to select ENCODE files by querying their 
metadata and download them.

The SQLite database can be regenerated at will to query ENCODE database locally 
keep it up-to-date.

This vignette will introduce the way to update ENCODE data.

### Loading ENCODEdb package

```{r libraryLoad}
suppressMessages(library(ENCODEdb))
```

### Data update

If you want regenerate this list, you have to process the following steps:

* generate the SQL database from ENCODE: 

```{r tables, eval=FALSE}
# the path (relative or absolute) to the future database
database_filename = "new.encode.sqlite"
tables = prepare_ENCODEdb(database_filename)
```

* generate the metadata encode_df from the SQL database:
```{r new_encode_df, eval = FALSE}
new_encode_df <- export_ENCODEdb_matrix(database_filename)
```


The whole process will take several minutes (5 to 15 minutes depending on your
work environment)

### Updated data usage

Once the `new_encode_df` is generated, you can use it to replace the default one 
in the `queryEncode` and `downloadEncode` function by setting the *df* option of those 
functions.

```{r queryEncode, eval=FALSE}
query_results <- queryEncode(df = new_encode_df, assay = "switchgear", target ="elavl1", file_format = "bed_broadPeak" , fixed = F)
downloadEncode(df = new_encode_df, resultSet = query_results, resultOrigin = "queryEncode")
```

Be sure to use the same referencial *df* for both **queryEncode** and **downloadEncode**.

You can also use the SQL database for own purpose. The imputed database 
model is available in the [dedicated vignette](DBmodel.html)
